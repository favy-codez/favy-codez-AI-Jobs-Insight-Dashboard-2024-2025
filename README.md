## Overview  
The **AI Jobs Insight Dashboard (2024-2025)** provides a comprehensive analysis of AI job market trends, covering areas such as remote work opportunities, average salaries, job postings, and industry trends. It is designed to help users navigate the rapidly evolving AI job landscape. The dashboard is divided into three key sections: **Talent & Pay Trends**, **Remote Work & Company Insights**, and **Workforce Dynamics**. Each section focuses on different aspects of the AI job market, offering insights into compensation, benefits, and job opportunities across various employment types and experience levels.

## Problem Statement  
AI professionals and companies often struggle to identify trends in remote work and salaries, which can make it difficult to attract and retain talent. They also face challenges in understanding which job types and industries offer the most competitive pay and benefits. Balancing workforce needs, whether remote, hybrid, or physical, adds another layer of complexity, as companies strive to create environments that are both attractive to employees and effective for business goals. Finally, both job seekers and employers must make data-driven decisions about career opportunities and workforce planning in an increasingly competitive market, yet often lack the insights needed to do so effectively.

## Observations  
### Remote Work  
- About **33.83%** of AI jobs are fully remote; hybrid and physical jobs each also make up roughly **33.3%**, indicating an even distribution.  
- Remote job opportunities **decrease over time**, suggesting a trend back toward physical or hybrid work.

### Salaries & Benefits  
- The **average salary** is around **$115.35K**, with a median of **$100K**.  
- The highest salaries are seen in roles like **machine learning engineer**, **head of AI**, and **AI architect**.  
- **Senior professionals** earn the most, while **entry-level salaries** are considerably lower.  
- **Benefits** are fairly consistent across companies, with scores around **7.5/10**.

### Job Postings  
- Postings **peak between March and July**, then drop sharply by August.  
- **Executive-level jobs** offer the highest pay but have fewer openings compared to mid-level and entry-level roles.

### Industry Trends  
- The **retail and media** industries pay the highest average salaries.  
- Countries like **Denmark, Switzerland, and the US** offer the most competitive pay.

## Insights  
Remote work is declining while hybrid and physical jobs are stabilizing, likely due to companies seeking in-person collaboration. Experience level strongly influences salary—entry-level professionals earn significantly less. Smaller companies are less likely to offer remote roles compared to large companies. Job postings have a seasonal trend, peaking mid-year—possibly aligned with budget cycles or project launches. Industry and location matter—tech-heavy countries and industries consistently offer higher pay.

## Recommendations  
### Job Seekers  
- Prioritize gaining experience to move into higher-paying senior roles.  
- Focus on industries like **retail**, **media**, and **consulting**, and consider relocating to countries like **Denmark** or **Switzerland** for better pay.  
- Be aware that remote roles might be declining—consider hybrid opportunities as a bridge.

### Employers  
- Consider offering more remote or hybrid roles to attract top talent, especially from smaller companies.  
- Develop competitive salary packages and benefits to retain top talent.  
- Strategically plan hiring around **March to July**, when job postings peak, to attract a larger pool of candidates.

### Policymakers  
- Monitor shifts in remote work policies and create incentives for industries to continue supporting remote and hybrid work.  
- Support programs to help entry-level professionals transition into higher-paying roles.
